    want to fit for purpose for my text and my classroom and my college
    I find a thing, it is in american english, I want to l18n the content to british english

    We have a site, we have users that come to the site, and we want users to be able to fork and distribute the content in other ways.
    We have a revision system, and we want to offer more utility

Josh Gay (FSF): (David)

    worked at ck12, built a content platform for authors
    authors would write content, port it to mediawiki, then import into FlexBooks
    Had to turn down other people because it did not fit the FlexBooks model
    Have a platform people can _create_ on, and then distribute wherever
    How can we standardize sharing and organization of OER content

Michelle O'Sousa (Floe): (Eleanor)

    Teacher with a blind student
    Want to existing content and make it accessible to the blind
    want to share that content when finished
    working on checking accessibility


TODO:
=====

 + Flesh out user stories
 + Match user stories
 + Use a short list of sites to present their usefulness



#### What does this add?
Forking
branching
merging
allowing requirements
discoverability

Translation and Localization
============================
Accessibility

MetaData
========
Use LRMI as a file in the repos, that a author fills out to fill out information about their repo
    that way the repo always contains that metadata when it goes elsewhere

CK12 has a mapping of State Curriculum standards against Common Core and against each other

Pathways and standards: How do I find the content that is right for me?
    Be able to tap into community opportunities
    be able lto find author profiles that are similar to me
